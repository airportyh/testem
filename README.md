Test&rsquo;em &rsquo;Scripts!
=================

Unit testing Javascripts shouldn't be an effing PITA. `testem` is a command-line tool which aims to make cross browser Javascript unit testing much more tolerable.

This project is a spin-off of [Tutti](https://github.com/airportyh/Tutti). I first thought I would repurpose Tutti to become a unit testing tool, but after much deliberation, decided to start a new project for this very purpose instead.

Usage:

***TODO***

Include Snippet
---------------

Include this snippet directly after your `jasmine.js` include to enable *Testem* with your
test page

    <script>
    if (location.hash === '#testem')
    	document.write('<script src="/jasmine_adapter.js"></'+'script>')
    </script>

For QUnit, include this snippet

    <script>
    if (location.hash === '#testem')
    	document.write('<script src="/qunit_adapter.js"></'+'script>')
    </script>

Work Arounds For Known Issues
=============================
1) Cannot find module './lib/js-yaml.js'

This is an issue in the upstream js-yaml.  The work around is described
here: https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml/pull/35

    npm install https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml/tarball/master

    or if you download the tar.gz locally

    npm install nodeca-js-yaml-0.3.5-0-g44441b0.tar.gz
